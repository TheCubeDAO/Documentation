# Proof of Play: A Player's Guide

## Overview
Welcome to Proof of Play, a groundbreaking system that redefines the gaming experience. Developed by CubeDAO, this innovative approach shifts away from the traditional game provider model. It focuses on tracking your gameplay statistics and activities to reward you with Virtual Cubit tokens. These Virtual Cubits can be exchanged for the Cubit ($CBIT) Governance token, as well as in-game cosmetics and valuables.

## CBIT Payments System

**Connecting Your Wallet**
Upon connecting to one of our gamemodes, players will receive a notification, prompting them to link a Polygon/Ethereum wallet to our [CUBE_Players](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x3f5f52150515e26ba76c914489aa030e6272894f) Smart Contract. 

Visit https://cubedao.net/ and sign in. The page includes a "Set Primary Wallet" button, upon clicking that you will be asked to sign a Signature which will create a unique line of data corresponding to your Profile UUID + Wallet Address.

**Cube Players Contract**
After creating the signature, you'll be prompted to approve a call to the CUBE Players contract. This call transfers your unique signature to the contract, ensuring we know where to send your rewards when you play on our servers!

**Proof of Play Mechanism**
Engaging in various game modes throughout The Cube allows players to accumulate Virtual Cubits based on their activities. Virtual Cubits, a unique in-game currency, can be used in the /shop to acquire valuable items or exchanged at the Currency Exchange for real-world crypto tokens such as $CBIT.

**Decentralized Organization**
CubeDAO envisions full decentralization, empowering the community to actively participate in managing and controlling the server through proposals and a governance hierarchy system.

## Virtual Cubits

**Earning Virtual Cubits**
Virtual Cubits can be earned through diverse in-game activities, such as playtime, quests, jobs, and player trading. This versatile currency encourages player engagement and can be used across different game modes on The Cube, fostering a unified economy.

**Cross-Server Currency**
Virtual Cubits transcend individual servers, allowing players to earn and spend them across various game modes. For instance, Virtual Cubits earned in Survival can be spent in other modes like KitPvP.

**Currency Exchange**
The Currency Exchange, a vital feature of Survival, enables players to convert Virtual Cubits into cryptocurrency tokens. The process involves two steps:

1. **Token Selection Menu:** Currently the only option available is Cubit ($CBIT) tokens on the Polygon blockchain.

2. **Token Rates Menu:** Specify the amount of Virtual Cubits for exchange, determining the ERC-20 cryptocurrency tokens received on the Polygon blockchain. For example, exchanging 1,000 Virtual Cubits might yield 1,000 $CBIT at a 1:1 ratio.

The Currency Exchange adds depth to the Proof of Play system, allowing players to tangibly benefit from their in-game efforts and enhancing the overall gaming experience.
