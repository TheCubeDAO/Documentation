# **Welcome to the Cube DAO!**

**CubeDAO** launched in 2021, and has been steadily growing as one of the first gaming projects to have a decentralized structure - allowing the players to truly own the game they’re contributing their time to. CubeDAO governs & controls The Cube Minecraft servers.

Join the ultimate gaming network, where you can unleash your creativity and explore all of our gamemodes. Our various enhancements to existing Minecraft gamemodes will keep you engaged and entertained.  **`play.cubedao.net`**


No matter what your preferred gameplay style is, you’ll be at home within The Cube. Whether you like to progress at a fast or slow pace, this is the right place for you!
