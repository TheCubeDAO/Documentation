<h2>Sign Shop</h2>
<p>To create a basic sign shop, place any type of sign on the chest/shulker/barrel you wish to turn into a shop and follow the format below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>[Shop]</strong>: This has to be the first line on the sign to indicate you are creating a shop.</li>
  <li><strong>64</strong>: Set the amount of items you want the shop to buy or sell.</li>
  <li><strong>1000</strong>: Set your desired price for the items you want to buy or sell.</li>
  <li><strong>Sell</strong> or <strong>Buy</strong>: Set your shop type to either buy items from other players or sell your own items to other players. Your choices are<strong> Sell</strong>, <strong>Buy</strong>, <strong>Barter</strong> or <strong>Gamble</strong>!</li>
  <li>Then, punch the sign while holding whatever item you wish to buy or sell, and you will now have a sign shop.</li>
