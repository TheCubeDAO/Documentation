### Incentive

Each month, members holding the "Consensus" role will receive an airdrop of tokens, reflecting their contribution and engagement within the Cube DAO community. This airdrop is calculated based on a proprietary metric known as 'points', which represents the user's activity and involvement throughout the community. The exact formula for calculating points is part of an internal closed-source system, ensuring fairness and preventing manipulation.

The token airdrop distribution is directly proportional to the number of points accumulated by each Consensus role holder. We prioritize transparency; thus, we publicly post reward distributions monthly in the Cube DAO Discord, allowing every member to view and understand the reward dynamics.

## How to Join the Consensus Group:
To attain the Consensus role, members need to demonstrate consistent and meaningful engagement within Cube DAO. Here are the various pathways to becoming a member:

- **Community Engagement:** Have an active presence in our Discord channels, actively participating in discussions, offering help, and providing valuable insights.
- **Event Participation:** Regularly engage in community events, whether it's tournaments, brainstorming sessions, or any other activities organized by the community.
- **Service Utilization:** Actively use the services offered by Cube DAO, showing support and contributing to the ecosystem's growth.

### Opt-In 
To join the Consensus group and start earning rewards, members must consciously opt-in. This ensures that only those interested and committed to the community's growth receive the rewards. Here's how to opt-in:

1. Visit your Profile on [Cube DAO's official website](https://cubedao.net).
2. Look for the Consensus Rewards Program section.
3. Indicate your willingness to participate by choosing to opt-in.

Through the Community Rewards Program, Cube DAO aims to build a self-sustaining ecosystem that rewards contributions, fosters innovation, and celebrates the collective efforts of its members. Join us in shaping the future of Cube DAO, where every member's contribution is recognized and rewarded.

### Reward Method

You must have completed the Opt-In process to receive rewards.

Every month, holders of the Consensus Role will have their community statistics checked and logged for the highest holders of points, this balance will reset each month. Once we are aware of the top holders we will post a detailed breakdown of the payouts for the month on our Discord server.
