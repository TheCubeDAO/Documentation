<h1>General Information</h1>
<p>Survival is a game mode full of opportunities, challenges, and difficulties for you to encounter. Here you are able to roam around the world freely, making your way through caves, dungeons, other dimensions and even other players' land!</p>
<p>Whether you are looking to play by yourself or with some friends, this is the right place for you to become a party of a community.</p>
<p>This page only covers the basics of getting started &amp; claiming land. View the specific pages for other gameplay features to grasp a better understanding.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Once you join the Survival server for the first time, you should become familiar with the spawn area by walking around, you will encounter NPC's (Non Player Characters) that will play an important role throughout your Survival experience.</p>
<p>As soon as you've familiarized yourself with the NPC's &amp; various bits of information placed within the spawn, take your first steps of surviving by going to the wilderness and starting your journey by typing <code>/wilderness</code> or <code>/rtp</code> (Random Teleport).</p>
<h2>Land Claiming</h2>
<p>You can use the <code>/claim</code> command to easily toggle the claim mode to evaluate and set new claim areas.</p>
<p>Claiming land is simple: right-click the ground in two opposite corners to claim your land. Claims must have an area of at least 100 blocks.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on a block to choose the corner of your claim.</li>
  <li>Right-click the opposite corner diagonally to claim within that area.</li>
  <li>Your claim should now be complete!</li>
</ol>
<p>To view your claims and available claimblocks, type <code>/claimlist</code>.<br><br>To remove a land claim, stand inside it and type <code>/abandonclaim</code> or abandon all of your claims with <code>/abandonallclaims</code></p>
<h3>Adding other players to your claim</h3>
<p>There are different ways you could ‚Äútrust‚Äù other players to your land. At any point you could use /untrust to remove their access. These levels of trust are like a hierarchy, higher levels of trust gain the benefits of the lower levels of trust, so if somebody has /trust, they also have the benefits of /accesstrust and /containertrust, but not /permissiontrust.</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>/accesstrust</code> (player or public): Allows players to use buttons, levers, pressure plates, and enter the claim if a NoEnter flag is enabled</li>
  <li><code>/containertrust</code> (player or public): Allows players to use containers and mobs</li>
  <li><code>/trust</code> (player or public): Allows players to build</li>
  <li><code>/permissiontrust</code> (player or public): Allows players to change permissions, such as levels of trust.</li>
</ul>
