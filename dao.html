<p><mark class="LightSkyBlue">Decentralization of the project has not been fully established yet.  
We want to clarify that our project is not driven by profit-seeking motives. Full decentralization has not been achieved yet, and our creators are not making any profits or seeking monetary gain from the work of others. The 'DAO' we mention is simply an organization of like-minded individuals collaborating on advancing a specific technology domain. It's important to understand that joining our community means recognizing that financial remuneration is not the goal, and significant risks are involved if you decide to contribute. Please be aware of these factors before getting involved.</mark></p>


<p>A game needs players. By simply playing the game, community members are adding value to the network and should be rewarded.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: Please note that anything written on this page and other pages should not be taken as financial advice. The Cube is incorporating unfinished, risky, and highly experimental technology. Development priorities and features are subject to change based on research, traction, feedback from the community, and a myriad of other factors.</p>
<h3>Proposals</h3>
<p>Proposals are the main way of participating in the DAO.</p>

<h2>Cubit ($CBIT) Token</h2>
<p>These are governance tokens for CubeDAO that operate on the Polygon blockchain as ERC-20 tokens. With these tokens, CubeDAO aims to incentivize players and developers to work towards a common goal of decentralizing ownership and governance of The Cube and its related services. The mechanisms employed by CubeDAO have two goals:</p>
<ol>
  <li>To reward players for interacting with DAO related projects and incentivize them to hold on to their tokens to claim additional rewards.</li>
  <li>To decentralize ownership and governance of The Cube and its related resources.</li>
</ol>

<p>Founders' Pass holders can claim rewards by staking their passes. Players can earn $CBIT by playing within the ecosystem and through user-generated content. CubeDAO aims to create the first gaming platform that is truly owned and operated by the community that plays it.</p>

<h3>Tokenomics</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Maximum Supply: &nbsp;</strong>(21,000,000 Cubits)<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Liquidity Reserves:</strong> 50% (10,500,000 Cubits) will be used to provide liquidity for the Cubits token on decentralized and centralized exchanges. The liquidity reserves will be used with MATIC on Uniswap to provide an efficient way for users to buy and sell Cubits.<br>9,000,000 (85%) of these tokens have been locked while the DAO raises liquidity to prevent risk of token sell offs. 3 Year Linear Lock (01 Jan 2026) <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0x12a83a68a57c2d05b6543a2a6a67922b8b77db82"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
<br>
  <li><strong>Creator Reserves:</strong> 5% (1,050,000 Cubits) will be allocated to the project's development team to provide long-term funding for the project's development and operations. The creator reserves will be subject to a lockup period and released over a period of months to prevent sudden sell-offs that could affect the price of the token. These tokens have been locked for a linear 5 year time period and will be slowly released to the creators. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0x77270e1772307d66410d1c20ecbf121cbb57afd2"> Click here</a><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Play-to-Earn Reserves:</strong> 20% (4,200,000 Cubits) will be allocated to a pool of rewards that players can earn while playing on existing game providers. These rewards will be subject to dynamic adjustments based on market conditions to help balance the market. To be eligible to tap into play-to-earn reserves you must own a successful project with active players. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xb35a3fa16473ff5020590ff32dcb4cebd1a928a1"> Click here</a><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Staking Reserves:</strong> 15% (3,150,000 Cubits) will be allocated to a pool of rewards that users can earn by staking their tokens.&nbsp;Once reserves run out no $CBIT may be claimed. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xe9a51d1a90341f4d68b801125b67d24c908733f2"> Click here</a><br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>DAO: </strong>10% (2,100,000 Cubits) will be allocated to the CubeDAO wallet that will allow token holders and founders to participate in key decisions. The DAO will be responsible for managing the project's development, allocating resources, and setting the direction of the project. The DAO allocation will provide a decentralized governance structure for the project. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xD6B640DADb33182D7d6AE733022B420A4eaDe0F9"> Click here</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Providing Liquidity</h3>
<p>By providing Liquidity to the $CBIT token on Uniswap, you will receive up to 1% of fees from every buy and sell. You will also help contribute to price stability.</p>
<h2>Founders Pass</h2>
<p>There will be a maximum of 1000 Founders on the Polygon blockchain. Owning a pass gives the ability to stake &amp; earn Cubits. Founders receive exclusive access to benefits such as a VIP pass on The Cube.&nbsp;<br><br>Creators of the DAO will reserve 100 passes for development, promotions, partner incentives, airdrops and events.&nbsp;<br><br>Founders Passes can be minted here: <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cubedao/drop">https://opensea.io/collection/cubedao/drop</a> - if they have sold out, you can buy from the secondary marketplace on OpenSea.<br><br>50% of proceeds generated from the OpenSea Drop will be contributed towards $CBIT liquidity on Uniswap (~$27,000) progressively.</p>
