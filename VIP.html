<h2><span class="text-big">Bones Token</span></h2>
<p>One of the most elusive features of being a <strong>V.I.P</strong> will be the ability to passively earn <a href="0x46B940815964cfDD01fcCD719CD58dBb502F94ea"><strong>$BONES</strong></a> tokens as you play within The Sewer Side worlds. Currently V.I.P's can earn $BONES token by staking their V.I.P pass on the DAO page!<br><br>The Bones Token Maximum Supply is Capped at 21,000,000 Tokens.</p>
<p>2,000,000 Tokens are reserved for development use.</p>

<h2><span class="text-big">How do I become a V.I.P?</span></h2>

<h2><span class="text-big">How do I claim my in-game perks?</span></h2>
<p>Once you have minted your <strong>V.I.P pass</strong> you must join our Discord server &amp; link your wallet with the V.I.P Pass to the Collab.Land Discord Bot.&nbsp;<br>To sync your in-game perks you must then link your Minecraft account with the /discord link command in-game.<br><br><span class="text-big"><strong>Step 1 - </strong></span><strong>Acquire V.I.P Pass.</strong> You must be connected to the Polygon network and have at least 68 MATIC + gas to mint an NFT Pass.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Step 2 - </strong></span><strong>Link your wallet with Collab.Land</strong> in the #collabland-join channel within our Discord server. You should receive a message saying you were granted the V.I.P role if successful.</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Step 3 - </strong></span><strong>Link your Minecraft account</strong> with your Discord account using the <strong>/discord link </strong>command in-game. You should receive a message saying your account was linked if successful.</p>
<h2><span class="text-big">How do I mint?</span></h2>
<p>Here's instructions on how to mint from start to finish!<br><br><span class="text-big"><strong>Step 1 -</strong></span> Install MetaMask wallet</p>
<p>As with any crypto asset, you will need a cryptocurrency <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/"><strong><u>wallet</u></strong></a> to mint and trade NFTs. The most popular wallet is <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/guide-to-using-metamask/"><strong><u>MetaMask</u></strong></a>, and that’s the wallet we will be using.</p>
<p><strong>MetaMask is a noncustodial wallet</strong> that you can easily download from the official MetaMask website and install as an extension on your browser.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Step 3 -</strong></span> Create a MetaMask account</p>
<p>If you haven’t used MetaMask before, you will need to create a new <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-wallets/"><strong><u>crypto wallet</u></strong></a>. The process is fairly simple and straightforward. Follow the steps and make sure to write down (using pen and paper) the seed phrase, which will be needed to later recover your wallet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Step 4 -</strong></span> Fund MetaMask wallet with MATIC tokens</p>
<p>An empty crypto wallet is worth nothing. That’s why you will need to fund it with crypto before you can start minting a V.I.P pass.</p>
<p>You will have to import the Polygon Network into MetaMask, here is a <a href="https://docs.polygon.technology/docs/develop/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/">quick guide&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>After you’ve created your MetaMask wallet, you can send funds to the wallet address displayed at the top, under the account name.</p>
<p>You can purchase MATIC tokens from Exchanges like Binance, FTX, Or earn them in-game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Step 5 -</strong></span> Connect wallet to the minting page</p>
<p>After you’ve created and funded the Polygon crypto wallet, you can connect your wallet to the project’s website and <strong>start minting.</strong></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:26.54%;"><img src="/download.png"></figure>
<p>Click on <strong>Connect with MetaMask</strong>,</p>
<p>In some cases, the button might not appear unless you click first on the MetaMask icon on your browser. It will ask you to reload the webpage and then to enter the MetaMask wallet password to sign in. After you do that, you will be able to connect the wallet to the project’s website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class="text-big"><strong>Step 6 -</strong></span> Select&nbsp;how many NFTs you want to mint</p>
<p>Investors can choose to mint between one and 40 NFTs. Each NFT minting will cost you 68 MATIC. If the project takes off, your NFTs might end up popular, and you can make a profit from selling them on an NFT marketplace<strong>.</strong></p>
