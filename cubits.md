## Value Capture
The majority of the value generated across the platform will be captured and funneled into the DAO which will be controlled and driven by the community members in the future when the project becomes fully open-sourced.

** Fiat purchases will be potentially discouraged over time and will be directed into on-chain transactions as much as commercially reasonable through on-ramp terminals for more accountability.

<br>

### On-chain Revenue ($CBIT, $TOPIA, $MATIC)

**Cubits:** In-game packages are sold at a discounted price in fiat denomination if paid directly with vCUBIT (Virtual Cubit). The discount rate is periodically adjusted based on the exchange rate of CBIT/MATIC pair to sustain fair pricing.

<br>

### NFT Revenue

Since the launch of the DAO, all proceeds from CubeDAO NFT's sold by the project (ie. $PASS) will be captured by the DAO controlled wallet.

There has been one sale during the time period since launch and all of the proceeds have entered or will enter the vault.
1. Founders $PASS OpenSea Drop
2. Future Revenue of NFT collections

<br>

### Marketplace Fees

Founders $PASS NFT's are available on multiple marketplaces supporting the Polygon blockchain including Opensea.

The core team members shall use a royalty fee capture rate of around 3~5% on most available NFT marketplaces, and these fee revenues will be captured & accrued in the DAO controlled wallet.

<br>

### Cubit Liquidity Miners

Cubit holders may demonstrate their trust in the project by locking up some of their $CBIT tokens in the CBIT/MATIC staking pool to get additional tokens and/or potentially other rewards.

This incentive will help stabilize/bolster the value of $CBIT and therefore allow the token incentives to effectively support the creators, contributors, and ecosystem participants within the ecosystem.


## Proof of Play Issuance

The PoP issuance represents 20% of the total supply. The goal of the PoP issuance portion is to distribute it to the players who participate in Proof of Play, through incentivizing the skills, and achievements of all gamers playing on The Cube.

As a sophisticated game, which combines PvE, PvP, and MMO gameplay, there are entire trees of skills, tactics, investment, and/or performances that deserve rewards. The game issuance essentially exists to do that. 

The possible usage is not exhaustive and will continue to evolve in ways to enhance the engagement, activities, and entertainment of the gamers. To name a few possible use cases: 
- Hourly active playtime rewards
- Ranking rewards based on leaderboard
- Winning a tournament
- Winning a PvP, PvE, or other contest in the game 
- Using the in-game marketplace
- Using future products that haven't been announced yet.


These allocations are something that could potentially be decided by governance over time.

**Gaming issuance history will be recorded and updated in the below sections:**

## Liquidity Mining

LP Mining is a way for us to reward our community members who are willing to lock up their tokens for having a commitment to the CBIT platform and ecosystem growth.

For any liquid asset like CBIT, locking up invites both the carrying and opportunity costs as well as exposure to unforeseen volatility. To compensate for these costs, the platform will offer yields based on the staking reward pool.

  <li><strong>Maximum Supply: &nbsp;</strong>(21,000,000 Cubits)<br>&nbsp;</li>
  <li><strong>Liquidity Reserves:</strong> 50% (10,500,000 Cubits) will be used to provide liquidity for the Cubits token on decentralized and centralized exchanges. The liquidity reserves will be used with MATIC on Uniswap to provide an efficient way for users to buy and sell Cubits.
    9,000,000 (85%) of these tokens have been locked while members raise funding to prevent risk of token sell offs. 3 Year Linear Lock (01 Jan 2026) <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0x12a83a68a57c2d05b6543a2a6a67922b8b77db82"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Creator Reserves:</strong> 5% (1,050,000 Cubits) will be allocated to the project's development team to provide long-term funding for the project's development and operations. The creator reserves will be subject to a lockup period and released over a period of months to prevent sudden sell-offs that could affect the price of the token. 
<br>
These tokens have been locked for a linear 5 year time period and will be slowly released to the creators. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0x77270e1772307d66410d1c20ecbf121cbb57afd2"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Proof of Play Reserves:</strong> 20% (4,200,000 Cubits) will be allocated to a pool of rewards that players can earn while playing on existing game providers. These rewards will be subject to dynamic adjustments based on market conditions to help balance the market. 
<br>To be eligible to tap into PoP reserves you must own a successful project with active players. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xb35a3fa16473ff5020590ff32dcb4cebd1a928a1"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Staking Reserves:</strong> 15% (3,150,000 Cubits) will be allocated to a pool of rewards that users can earn by staking their $CBIT tokens or a Founders $PASS.&nbsp;
<br>Once pre-defined reserves run out no further rewards may be claimed. The committee can vote to change this via proposal. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xe9a51d1a90341f4d68b801125b67d24c908733f2"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>DAO (Committee): </strong>10% (2,100,000 Cubits) will be allocated to the committee that will allow members and founders to participate in key decisions. The DAO will be responsible for managing the project's development, allocating resources, and setting the direction of the project. 
The DAO allocation will provide a decentralized governance structure for the project. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xD6B640DADb33182D7d6AE733022B420A4eaDe0F9"> Click here</a></li>

*The committee vault refers to one or more blockchain addresses that effectively capture and accrue values across the game, that will be eventually controlled by the $CBIT token holders.*
