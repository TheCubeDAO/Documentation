## Cubit Staking Incentives

Cubit holders may demonstrate their trust in the project by locking up some of their Cubit tokens into the CUBE_Staking smart contract, this contract creates a Staking Pool with a dynamic interest reward of Cubit based on how many total stakers exist and how many total tokens are within the pool.

Holders looking to get more potential out of their tokens with added risk can become Liquidity Providers by providing a portion (e.g; 50/50) of tokens to the Liquidity Pool, this will reward you with a portion ~(1%) of the fees accrued from all Cubit swaps on the Uniswap platform. To demonstrate further trust in the project, you are able to lock up your $LP-Provider token for a set duration of time to receive a dynamic interest rate of Cubit tokens.

This incentive will help stabilize/bolster the value of Cubits and therefore allow the token incentives to effectively support the creators, contributors, and ecosystem participants.

We would like to clarify that the Cubit token may not have a market value, if it currently does, assume it does not. We do not facilitate or support methods or attempts to sell the Cubit token or connections linking it to real-world currency. The Cubit token is a community utility token operating mainly on the Polygon blockchain.

> The staking platform is under re-development as of Dec, 2023. Stay updated via Discord.

## Proof of Play Issuance

The PoP issuance represents 20% of the total supply. The goal of the PoP issuance portion is to distribute it to the players who participate in Proof of Play, through incentivizing the skills, and achievements of all gamers playing on The Cube.

As a sophisticated game, which combines PvE, PvP, and MMO gameplay, there are entire trees of skills, tactics, investment, and/or performances that deserve rewards. The game issuance essentially exists to do that. 

The possible usage is not exhaustive and will continue to evolve in ways to enhance the engagement, activities, and entertainment of the gamers. To name a few possible use cases: 
- Setting up an advanced in-game economy through systems like Chest Shops.
- Hourly active playtime rewards
- Participating in Quests
- Receiving a virtual in-game Job
- Ranking rewards based on leaderboard
- Winning a tournament
- Winning a PvP, PvE, or other contest in the game 
- Using the in-game marketplace
- Using future products that haven't been announced yet.


These allocations are something that could potentially be decided by governance over time.

**Gaming issuance / Proof of Play tokens are only distributed from this address as of Dec, 2023:**

### Tokenomics Explained
 
<ul>
  <li><strong>Liquidity Reserves:</strong> 50% (10,500,000 Cubits) will be allocated to specific use-cases requiring liquidity, including sponsorships, partnerships, promotional uses, community engagement, brand awareness, giveaways, project sustainability and more.
    <br>9,000,000 (85%) of these tokens have been locked while the projects development team build core infrastructure. 3 Year Linear Lock (01 Jan 2026) <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0x12a83a68a57c2d05b6543a2a6a67922b8b77db82"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Creator Reserves:</strong> 5% (1,050,000 Cubits) will be allocated to the project's development team to provide long-term support for the project's development and operations. The creator reserves will be subject to a lockup period and released over a period of months to prevent sudden movements that could affect the stability of the token. 
<br>
These tokens have been locked for a linear 5 year time period and will be slowly released to the creators. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0x77270e1772307d66410d1c20ecbf121cbb57afd2"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Proof of Play Reserves:</strong> 20% (4,200,000 Cubits) will be allocated to a pool of rewards that players can earn while playing on existing game providers. These rewards will be subject to dynamic adjustments. 
<br>To be eligible to tap into PoP reserves you must own a successful project with active players. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xb35a3fa16473ff5020590ff32dcb4cebd1a928a1"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Staking Reserves:</strong> 15% (3,150,000 Cubits) will be allocated to a pool of rewards that users can earn by staking their Cubit tokens or a Founders $PASS.&nbsp;
<br>Once pre-defined reserves run out no further rewards may be claimed. The DAO can vote to change this via proposal. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xe9a51d1a90341f4d68b801125b67d24c908733f2"> Click here</a>&nbsp;</li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>DAO: </strong>10% (2,100,000 Cubits) will be allocated to the DAO that will allow members and founders to participate in key decisions. The DAO will be responsible for managing the project's development, allocating resources, and setting the direction of the project. 
The DAO allocation will provide a decentralized governance structure for the project. <a href="https://polygonscan.com/token/0x4c989b872e96c37bc6fcb2f0fe5fdcabecc405a2?a=0xD6B640DADb33182D7d6AE733022B420A4eaDe0F9"> Click here</a></li>
</ul>



*The DAO refers to one or more blockchain addresses that effectively capture and accrue values across the game, that will be eventually controlled by the Cubit token holders.*
