Enchantment orbs can be applied to armor/weapons and will increase the amount of enchants you can apply on that item by the number specified in the orb command.

<font size="6">White Scroll</font>
Applying one of these to your item will protect it from being destroyed from a failed enchantment.

<font size="6">Secret, Mystery, and Magic Dust</font>
Increase book(s) success rate, while decreasing failure. The higher the success rate, the higher chance of the enchantment applying to the item.

<font size="6">Black Scroll</font>
Applying this item will take away one random custom enchantment from the item, and give a book of it with certain success & destroy rates.

<font size="6">Randomization Scrolls</font>
Applying one of these to the given custom enchant book will randomize the success and destroy rates.

<font size="6">Item Nametags</font>

<font size="6">Alchemist</font>
Combine two dusts to receive a better rate. Combine two enchantment books for increased enchantment level (i.e. two Speed I books for Speed II)

<font size="6">How to obtain souls?</font>
Souls can be gathered by killing players using weapons with Soul Trackers applied on them. For every player kill with an item that has a soul tracker, they will gain 1 soul on the item. There is also a small possibility of receiving souls while mining.

Assuming everything was done correctly, you should now have the augment you wanted.


<font size="6">Applying</font>
To apply your augment, type /fish augment and follow the steps to apply it to your Fishing Rod. You can also remove enchantments from your Fishing Rod from this menu for a cost of 25,000 Entropy
 


<font size="6">Fishing Parties</font>
Standing with other players & fishing will reward a party buff, this is capped at 5 players for the maximum buff. 
Players must be within 30 Blocks of each other to become a party.


<font size="6">Totems</font>
For the experienced fishers, you can build Totems which will reward a special power like effects & passive bonuses (/fish totem)
Building a totem can be expensive so this is recommended for the experienced fishers.



# üè™ PLAYER SHOPS

This is not related to the servers market (/shop) this purely covers player based shops.
 
There are two types of shop systems a player can create in the game: a basic buy/sell sign shop and an advanced physical player shop.

The physical shop system is more complex and includes advanced economic market features such as buy limiting, sell limiting, dynamic pricing, and more.

<font size="6">Basic Sign Shop</font>
To create a basic sign shop, place any type of sign on the chest you wish to turn into a shop and follow the format below:

- **[Shop]**: This has to be the first line on the sign to indicate you are creating a shop.
- **64**: Set the amount of items you want the shop to buy or sell.
- **1000**: Set your desired price for the items you want to buy or sell.
- **Sell** or **Buy**: Set your shop type to either buy items from other players or sell your own items to other players.
- Then, punch the sign while holding whatever item you wish to buy or sell, and you will now have a sign shop.

<font size="6">Advanced Player Shop</font>
To create a physical player shop, hold the shop creation item and place it on the ground exactly where you want your shop to be. You will then receive a message in the chat box with the next steps.

To select the item you wish to sell or buy, hold shift and right-click the base of the player shop. To select your buy or sell price and other options, right-click the base of the player shop.


<font size="6">**Commands**</font>
- **/ShopList**: View all shops on the server.
- 
- **/ShopNotifications**: Toggle buy/sell shop notifications on/off.
